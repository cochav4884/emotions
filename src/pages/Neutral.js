          <li>Go to bed or take a nap.</li>
          <li>
            Stick with "I" statements (I am feeling…, I am feeling neutral because…, I want to try…).
          </li>
          <li>
            Write down why you're feeling neutral (then crumple it up and throw it away).
          </li>
          <li>
            Embrace confrontation. Try to understand the other person and think before you respond.

          <li>
            Sometimes, not saying anything is the best option. Just listen and come back later to talk.
            Breathe.
