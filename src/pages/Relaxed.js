          Look through the suggestions and find what works best for you.

          <li>Take your time to respond.</li>
          <li>Unsure of outcomes of feeling relaxed? Write down your fears.</li>
          <li>Talk to someone about your feeling of being relaxed.</li>
          <li>Once you have identified the problem, consider different solutions to the problem.</li>
          <li>Choose an easy activity to ease your mind (art, music, watching TV).</li>
          <li>Go to bed or take a nap.</li>
          <li>
            Stick with "I" statements (I am feeling..., I am feeling relaxed because..., I want to try...).
          </li>
          <li>
            Write down why you are relaxed (when you're finished, crumple it up and throw it away).
          </li>
          <li>
            Embrace confrontation. Try to understand what the other person is saying. Take your time to think about it before you respond.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes, not saying anything is the best solution. Just listen and come back later to talk about the situation. Breathe.
