          Everyone shares the feeling of love differently. <br />
          Look through the suggestions and find what works best for you.
        </h3>
        <ul className="emotion mt-4">
          <li>Understand why you are feeling love and share that knowledge with someone else.</li>
          <li>Recognize and accept the emotion as a normal part of life.</li>
          <li>Keep a journal of feeling love to refer to on bad days.</li>
          <li>Once you have identified a concern, consider different solutions.</li>
          <li>Choose a physical activity to do with others (running, swimming, sports, etc.).</li>
          <li>
            Help others who are having a bad day—but protect your own mood and emotions.
          </li>
          <li>Use "I" statements (I am feeling…, I feel loved because…, I want to try…).</li>
          <li>Grow your circle of friends—step out and meet someone new.</li>
          <li>Embrace confrontation thoughtfully. Listen first, reflect, and then respond.</li>
          <li>Develop a passion and invest in a new hobby.</li>
