          <li>Sit in a quiet place and write down why you are feeling lost.</li>
          <li>If unsure about outcomes, write down your fears.</li>
          <li>Talk to someone you trust about why you are feeling lost.</li>
          <li>Once you have identified the problem, consider different solutions.</li>
          <li>Choose an easy activity to ease your mind (art, music, watching TV).</li>
          <li>Go to bed or take a nap.</li>
          <li>Stick with "I" statements (I am feeling…, I am lost because…, I want to try…).</li>
          <li>Write down what is making you feel lost (then crumple it up and throw it away).</li>
          <li>Embrace confrontation thoughtfully. Listen first, think it over, then respond.</li>
          <li>Sometimes, not saying anything is best. Just listen, breathe, and return later.</li>
