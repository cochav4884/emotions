          Look through the suggestions and find what works best for you.

          <li>Sit in a quiet place and write down why you are feeling lost.</li>
          <li>If unsure about outcomes, write down your fears.</li>
          <li>Talk to someone you trust about why you are feeling lost.</li>
          <li>
            Once you have identified the problem, consider different solutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Choose an easy activity to ease your mind (art, music, watching TV).
          </li>
          <li>Go to bed or take a nap.</li>
          <li>
            Stick with "I" statements (I am feeling…, I am lost because…, I want
            to try…).
          </li>
          <li>
            Write down what is making you feel lost (then crumple it up and
            throw it away).
          </li>
          <li>
            Embrace confrontation thoughtfully. Listen first, think it over,
            then respond.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes, not saying anything is best. Just listen, breathe, and
            return later.
          </li>
