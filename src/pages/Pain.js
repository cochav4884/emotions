          <li>Sit in a quiet place and write down why you are feeling pain.</li>
          <li>If youâ€™re unsure about the outcome, write down your fears.</li>
          <li>Talk to someone you trust about why you are feeling emotional pain.</li>
          <li>Once you identify the problem, consider different solutions.</li>
          <li>Choose an easy activity to ease your mind (art, music, watching TV).</li>
          <li>Go to bed or take a nap.</li>
          <li>
            Stick with "I" statements (I am feeling..., I am feeling emotional pain because..., I want to try...).
          </li>
          <li>
            Write down what is making you feel emotional pain (when finished, crumple it up and throw it away).
          </li>
          <li>
            Embrace confrontation. Try to understand what the other person is saying and take time to think before
            responding.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes, not saying anything is the best solution. Just listen and come back later to talk it over. Breathe.
