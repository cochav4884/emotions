          <li>If youâ€™re unsure about the outcome, write down your fears.</li>
          <li>
            Talk to someone you trust about why you are feeling emotional pain.

          <li>Once you identify the problem, consider different solutions.</li>
          <li>
            Choose an easy activity to ease your mind (art, music, watching TV).
          </li>
          <li>Go to bed or take a nap.</li>
          <li>
            Stick with "I" statements (I am feeling..., I am feeling emotional
            pain because..., I want to try...).
          </li>
          <li>
            Write down what is making you feel emotional pain (when finished,
            crumple it up and throw it away).
          </li>
          <li>
            Embrace confrontation. Try to understand what the other person is
            saying and take time to think before responding.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes, not saying anything is the best solution. Just listen and
            come back later to talk it over. Breathe.
