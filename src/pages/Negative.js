          <li>If you feel out of control, walk away from the situation temporarily, until you cool down.</li>
          <li>Recognize and accept the emotion as a normal part of life.</li>
          <li>Talk to someone you trust about why you are feeling negative.</li>
          <li>Once you have identified the problem, consider different solutions to the problem.</li>
          <li>Choose a physical activity to do such as running, swimming, exercising, or playing a sport.</li>
          <li>Think before you speak.</li>
          <li>Stick with "I" statements (I am feeling…, I am feeling negative because…, I want to try…).</li>
          <li>Write down why you are feeling negative (when finished, crumple it up and throw it away).</li>
          <li>Embrace confrontation. Try to understand what the other person is saying—take time before responding.</li>
          <li>Sometimes, not saying anything is the best solution. Just listen and return later to talk. Breathe.</li>
