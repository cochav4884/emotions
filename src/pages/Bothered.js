          <li>Eat something that makes you feel better.</li>
          <li>Recognise and accept the emotion as a normal part of life.</li>
          <li>Talk to someone you trust about why you are feeling bothered.</li>
          <li>Once you have identified the problem, consider different solutions to the problem.</li>
          <li>Choose an activity such as art, music, cooking to take your mind off the issue.</li>
          <li>Go to bed or take a nap.</li>
          <li>Stick with "I" statements (I am feeling.., I am bothered because.., I want to try..).</li>
          <li>Write down what is bothering you (when you are finished, crumple it up and throw it away).</li>
          <li>Embrace confrontation. Try to understand what the other person is saying, take your time to think about it before you respond.</li>
          <li>Sometimes, not saying anything is the best solution. Just listen and come back later to talk about the situation over. Breathe.</li>
