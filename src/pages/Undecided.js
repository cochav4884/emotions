          Everyone has to work through their feeling of being undecided in
          different ways. <br />
          Look through the suggestions and find what works best for you

            Sit in a quiet place and write down why you are feeling undecided.
          </li>
          <li>Unsure of outcomes of being undecided, write down your fears.</li>
          <li>
            Talk to someone you trust about why you are feeling undecided.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you have identified the problem, consider different solutions
            to the problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            Choose an easy activity to ease your mind (art, music, watching tv).
          </li>
          <li>Go to bed or take a nap.</li>
          <li>
            Stick with "I" statements (I am feeling..., I am undecided
            because..., I want to try...).
          </li>
          <li>
            Write down why you are feeling undecided (when you are finished,
            crumple it up and throw it away).
          </li>
          <li>
            Embrace confrontation. Try to understand what the other person is
            saying, take your time to think about it before you respond.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes, not saying anything is the best solution. Just listen and
            come back later to talk about the situation over. Breathe.
