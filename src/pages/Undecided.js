          Everyone has to work through their feeling of being undecided in different ways. <br />
          Look through the suggestions and find what works best for you
        </h3>
        <ul className="emotion mt-4">
          <li>Sit in a quiet place and write down why you are feeling undecided.</li>
          <li>Unsure of outcomes of being undecided, write down your fears.</li>
          <li>Talk to someone you trust about why you are feeling undecided.</li>
          <li>Once you have identified the problem, consider different solutions to the problem.</li>
          <li>Choose an easy activity to ease your mind (art, music, watching tv).</li>
          <li>Go to bed or take a nap.</li>
          <li>Stick with "I" statements (I am feeling..., I am undecided because..., I want to try...).</li>
          <li>Write down why you are feeling undecided (when you are finished, crumple it up and throw it away).</li>
          <li>
            Embrace confrontation. Try to understand what the other person is saying, take your time to think about it
            before you respond.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes, not saying anything is the best solution. Just listen and come back later to talk about the
            situation over. Breathe.
